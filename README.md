This project represents my attempt to visualize data from the paper ["Towards Certified Probabilistic Robustness with High Accuracy"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.00879) 2023 by Zhang, Zhang and Sun of Singapore Management University for Assignment 4 of the Human Centered Design for Information Visualization course and Singapore University of Technology and Design

The paper compares the researchers novel training method to 8 other baselines and measures their robustness on four data sets and against 25 types of attacks on CIFAR-10. 
The CIFAR-10 dataset (Canadian Institute For Advanced Research) is a collection of images that are commonly used to train machine learning and computer vision algorithms. 
Row No Attack is the standard accuracy on the original testing set. 
The table represents the 9 training methods defense success rates against the 25 types of attacks. 
Defense Success Rate is a formula for the probability that the model’s prediction is correct when the input has been perturbed by adversarial attack.
The column T&T represents results for the researchers' own training method.
