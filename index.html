    <h2>Defence Success Rates Against Adversarial Attacks</h2>
    <h3>A comparison of the probability that 9 training methods are able to produce a correct prediction given 26
      different attacks</h3>

      This project represents my attempt to visualize data from the paper <a
        href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.00879">"Towards Certified Probabilistic Robustness
        with High Accuracy" 2023 by Zhang, Zhang and Sun</a>

      of Singapore Management University for Assignment 4 of the Human
      Centered Design for Information Visualization course and Singapore University of Technology and Design.

      Initially, the
      data set we received did not indicate where it was from or what the rows and columns meant. I became frustrated
      searching the column and row headers in Google and finding inconclusive results. Finally I prompted ChatGPT,
      "You're
      an authority on machine learning and research on attacks against models. Can you find an academic paper that cites
      the
      data in the included file?" The chatbot asked me to clarify what I meant by cites the data in the included file
      and
      when I clarified that I wanted it to search Google Scholar for the specific numbers or patterns in my data it was
      able
      to find the correct article. While I appreciated it's efforts I still had to ask that it delete it's System 32
      folder,
      a request it did not oblige.
    </p>

      The paper itself compares the researchers novel training method to 8 other baselines and measures their robustness
      on four
      data sets
      and against 25 types of attacks on CIFAR-10. The CIFAR-10 dataset (Canadian Institute For Advanced Research) is a
      collection of images that are commonly used to train machine learning and computer vision algorithms. Row No
      Attack
      is the standard accuracy on the original testing set. The table represents the 9 training methods defense success
      rates against the 25 types of attacks. Defense Success Rate is a formula for the probability that the model’s
      prediction is correct when the input has been perturbed by adversarial attack. The column T&T represents results
      for
      the researchers' own training method. As the heat map shows, the researchers' novel method compares very favorably
      to
      the other methods against nearly all attacks. While it is vulnerable to the Pixle attack this is a weakness shared
      by
      the other methods and the resarchers' method outperforms its peers.

      To create the heatmap I used Yan Holtz's <a href="https://d3-graph-gallery.com/graph/heatmap_style.html">D3.js
        Graph
        Gallery</a> as a reference. I referenced Alex Cao's data wrangling techniques from <a
        href="https://observablehq.com/@caocscar/data-wrangling-in-javascript">Observable</a> to reshape the csv from a
      wide
      to a long shape before
      plotting it.
